## Variant 4

### Set based on hash-map, separate chaining

    You can use the built-in list for storing buckets and a bucket itself. 
    You need to check that your implementation correctly works with None value.

## Design notes

  Implementation restrictions:
  According to my understanding, the key and value of the set should be the same value, 
  but still must enter two,otherwise some operations cannot be implemented,
  I don't know how to solve this problem.

  Advantages of unittest:
  Unnitest is more compatible

  DisAdvantages of unittest:
  More limited

## Conclusion

  I'm a little rusty with Python, and I'm doing the best I can
